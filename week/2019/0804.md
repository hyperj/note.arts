### [How to Extend Apache Spark with Customized Optimizations](https://databricks.com/session/how-to-extend-apache-spark-with-customized-optimizations)

There are a growing set of optimization mechanisms that allow you to achieve competitive SQL performance. Spark has extension points that help third parties to add customizations and optimizations without needing these optimizations to be merged into Apache Spark. This is very powerful and helps extensibility. We have added some enhancements to the existing extension points framework to enable some fine grained control. This talk will be a deep dive at the extension points that is available in Spark today. We will also talk about the enhancements to this API that we developed to help make this API more powerful. This talk will be of benefit to developers who are looking to customize Spark in their deployments.
