### [Fast and Reliable Apache Spark SQL Engine](https://databricks.com/session/fast-and-reliable-apache-spark-sql-engine)

Building the next generation Spark SQL engine at speed poses new challenges to both automation and testing. At Databricks, we are implementing a new testing framework for assessing the quality and performance of new developments as they produced. Having more than 1,200 worldwide contributors, Apache Spark follows a rapid pace of development. At this scale, new testing tooling such as random query and data generation, fault injection, longevity stress, and scalability tests are essential to guarantee a reliable and performance Spark later in production. By applying such techniques, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of our testing infrastructure by drilling-down into cases where correctness and performance regressions have been found early. In addition, showing how they have been root-caused and fixed to prevent regressions in production and boosting the continuous delivery of new features.
