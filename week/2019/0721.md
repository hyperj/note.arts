## Review

### [Efficient Upserts into Data Lakes with Databricks Delta](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/03/19/efficient-upserts-into-data-lakes-databricks-delta.html)

Databricks Delta, the next-generation engine built on top of Apache Spark™, now supports the MERGE command, which allows you to efficiently upsert and delete records in your data lakes. MERGE dramatically simplifies how a number of common data pipelines can be built; all the complicated multi-hop processes that inefficiently rewrote entire partitions can now be replaced by simple MERGE queries. This finer-grained update capability simplifies how you build your big data pipelines for various use cases ranging from change data capture to GDPR.
